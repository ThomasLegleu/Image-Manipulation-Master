## About

- This code was generated at Southern California Institute of Architecture during a visual studies cpurse "Exact Forms " and 
pre-thesis seminar.

- Initial behaviors were developed Michael Casey Rehm from the Spring 2015 and Casey Reas in the Summer of 2015 and further developed by myself for project research.
